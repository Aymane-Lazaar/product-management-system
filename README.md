# JavaScript CRUDS - Product Management System

This is a complete CRUDS (Create, Read, Update, Delete, Search) application built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It functions as a simple product management system where you can add, manage, and search for products. All data is saved locally in the user's browser using `localStorage`.

*(**Note:** To add this, take a screenshot of your project, add it to your repository (e.g., as `screenshot.png`), and this text will automatically display it.)*

## ✨ Features

* **Create:** Add new products with details like title, price, taxes, ads, discount, count, and category.
* **Read:** View all existing products in a clean, organized table.
* **Update:** Easily edit the information of any existing product.
* **Delete:** Remove a single product from the list.
* **Delete All:** A "Delete All" button appears to clear the entire product list at once.
* **Search:** Dynamically search for products by either **Title** or **Category**.
* **Automatic Total:** The total price is calculated automatically as you type in the price fields.
* **Data Persistence:** All product data is saved in the browser's `localStorage`, so your items will still be there even after you close or refresh the page.
* **Input Validation:** Basic validation is included to ensure key fields (like title and price) are filled out and to prevent creating more than 100 items at a time.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** For the structure and layout of the application.
* **CSS3:** For all styling (this project uses an external `style.css` file).
* **JavaScript (Vanilla):** For all the application logic, DOM manipulation, and event handling.
* **Browser `localStorage`:** For persisting data on the client-side.
